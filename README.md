# International coordination in LTE licensing
## Ivan Vallejo Vall, June 2017

The latest data from the Global mobile Suppliers Association (GSA) on LTE deployments worldwide is used to test whether there is evidence of international coordination in LTE licensing.

The network structure is constructed based on a simple objective criterion: geographical borders. Departing from these graphs, the proposed approach is to analyze the status of neighboring nodes (i.e. licensed/not licensed LTE) once a given country decides to license LTE. By comparing the distribution of direct neighbors when a country decides to license LTE against a random model in which country's would decide irrespective of their neighbors allows to test for evidence of coordination.

The analysis carried out in this project finds evidence of coordination in LTE licensing in Europe. Indeed, the graph analysis suggests that coordination has taken place between different sub-groups of countries in Europe, not just among European Union Member States.

On the other hand, no evidence of coordination in LTE licensing is found in the Americas, nor in Asia and the Pacific.

The analysis and results are presented in the PDF document published in this repository. The R source code is included in the file 'analysis.R' and the figures and maps produced by the code are saved in the respective folders.
